# Security
- Authentication and Authorization

- Each team member and project lead must be assigned to a project
- Managers are never assigned to a specific project
- Only managers can define and maintain projects and people
- Everyone can enter new issues
- Once assigned, only the person assigned or a project lead can change data about the issue
